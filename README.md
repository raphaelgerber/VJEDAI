# VJEDAI

VJEDAI (V-JEPA Encoder for Depth Anything Inference) is a hybrid monocular depth estimation model using a V-JEPA 2.1 visual encoder coupled to a Depth Anything V2 depth decoder. 

## VJEDAI pipeline

The core model pairs a **frozen V-JEPA 2.1 encoder** with a **trainable Depth Anything V2 DPT decoder** and a **per-pixel Gaussian uncertainty head**. Four intermediate V-JEPA token maps are reshaped to patch grids and fed through the DPT head; the model outputs a depth map and a log-variance map. Training is scale-invariant (per-image), with two separate objectives you choose between: `si_mse` (depth only) and `nll` (heteroscedastic Gaussian, default). See the report for details.

Key files:
- `Full_Pipeline_JepaDepth.py` — end-to-end training + submission.
- `src/jepa_depth_anything.py` — the model (`build_jepa_depth_anything`).
- `src/{dataset,preprocessing,create_submission}.py` — data, V-JEPA input prep, Kaggle CSV.
- `utils/infer_jdepth.py` — standalone inference from a checkpoint.
- `utils/train_vjepa_linear_depth.py` — frozen-encoder linear-probe baseline.

### Environment setup

Runs on the CIL cluster conda env, plus a few pip packages and two external repos cloned under `external/`:

```bash
conda activate /cluster/courses/cil/envs/envs/monocular-depth-estimation
pip install opencv-python timm einops

git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/vjepa2.git external/vjepa2
git clone https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2.git external/Depth-Anything-V2
pip install -r external/Depth-Anything-V2/requirements.txt

export PYTHONPATH="external/vjepa2/src:external/vjepa2:$PWD/src:$PYTHONPATH"
```

`train_jdepth.sbatch` performs all of the above automatically (it expects the project at `$HOME/mono`). Checkpoints are written to `$SCRATCH/checkpoints/jepa_depth_<variant>/`.

### Training

Pick one objective per run via `JDEPTH_LOSS_MODE` (the two are independent trainings, not stages):

```bash
sbatch train_jdepth.sbatch                          # nll (default): Gaussian uncertainty
JDEPTH_LOSS_MODE=si_mse sbatch train_jdepth.sbatch  # depth only, no uncertainty
```

Checkpoints are tagged by mode (`best_<mode>.pth`), so the two runs don't clobber each other. Model selection uses validation SI-RMSE; a `submission.csv` is written on each new best.

### Inference

```bash
# Default: downloads the published checkpoint from HuggingFace
python utils/infer_jdepth.py --out submission.csv

# Or use a local checkpoint / a different HF file
python utils/infer_jdepth.py --ckpt path/to/best_nll.pth
python utils/infer_jdepth.py --hf-repo kalandarX/jdepth --hf-file large/v1.2_nll_deliverable.pth
```


## Experiments

This repository contains two experiment notebooks for training and evaluating Depth Anything decoder heads:

- `experiments/da_train.ipynb`
- `experiments/da_evaluate.ipynb`

Both notebooks support experiments with **Depth Anything V2** and **Depth Anything 3**. The main goal is to compare the prediction heads and to test whether the depth prediction heads perform better when they are fine-tuned from pretrained weights or trained after random re-initialization, while keeping the backbone frozen.

### Data Format

The notebooks expect the training data to be located in `data/train/`. The training directory should contain RGB images (`.png`) and matching depth maps (`.npy`). To recreate our exact results, the data should come from the [ETHZ CIL Monocular Depth Estimation 2026 kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ethz-cil-monocular-depth-estimation-2026).

A deterministic train/validation split is created automatically and stored in `splits/`. This ensures that all experiments use the same validation samples and can be compared fairly.

### Training Notebook

The notebook `experiments/da_train.ipynb` is used to train the depth prediction head of either Depth Anything V2 or Depth Anything 3. In the configuration cell, choose the model family:

```python
MODEL_FAMILY = 'DA2' # or 'DA3'
```

and choose how the prediction head should be initialized:

```python
WEIGHTS_SOURCE = 'pretrained' # fine-tune pretrained head 

# or `reset` to train randomly reinitialized head
```

The notebook freezes the full pretrained model and re-enables gradients only for the prediction head. This allows a fair comparison between different decoder head initialization strategies.

The training objective combines:
1. an L1 depth reconstruction loss, and
2. a gradient-matching loss that encourages locally similar depth structure.

During training, the notebook evaluates the model on the validation split using scale-invariant RMSE. It saves one checkpoint after every epoch and also stores the best checkpoint according to validation si-RMSE. Checkpoints are written to `checkpoints/` with names such as
```
DA2_pretrained_epoch_001.pt
DA2_pretrained_best.pt
DA3_reset_epoch_001.pt
DA3_reset_best.pt
```

### Evaluation Notebook

The notebook `experiments/da_evaluate.ipynb` is used to evaluate either a pretrained model or a trained checkpoint on the same validation split used during training.

In the configuration cell, choose the model family:

```python
MODEL_FAMILY = 'DA2' # or 'DA3'
```

and choose whether to evaluate the original pretrained model or a trained head checkpoint:

```python
WEIGHTS_SOURCE = 'pretrained' # or checkpoint
```

When evaluating a checkpoint, uncomment the corresponding checkpoint file, for example:

```python
CHECKPOINT = 'DA2_finetuned.pt'
# CHECKPOINT = 'DA3_finetuned.pt'
```

The evaluation notebook loads the base pretrained model and then replaces the depth prediction heads with the checkpoint weights. By default, checkpoints are downloaded from the Hugging Face repository `ragerber13/depth-anything-custom-heads`. 

The notebook computes the following validation metrics:

- `mean_si_RMSE`: mean per-image scale-invariant RMSE
- `AbsRel`: absolute relative depth error
- `Delta1`: fraction of valid pixels where prediction and ground truth agree within a factor of 1.25

Evaluation results are saved as CSV files in `evaluation_results/` with names such as:

```
eval_DA2_finetuned.csv
eval_DA3_finetuned.csv
eval_DA2_pretrained.csv
```

### Typical Workflow
1. Place the training data in `data/train/`.
2. Open `experiments/da_train.ipynb`.
3. Select `MODEL_FAMILY` and `WEIGHTS_SOURCE`.
4. Run the notebook to train the prediction head.
5. Use the best checkpoint from `checkpoints/`.
6. Open `experiments/da_evaluate.ipynb`.
7. Select the same model family and the checkpoint to evaluate.
8. Run the notebook to compute validation metrics and save the results.
